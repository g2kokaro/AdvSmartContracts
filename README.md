# tüb crowdfunding

This is a set of smart contracts for tüb, our decentralized video platform. The contracts allow content creators to crowdfund their upcoming projects, similar to kickstarter.

The concepts used are multiple contract interactions, separate storage and logic contracts, and upgradeable smart contracts. The Registry contract [is deployed here](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xde342587b6eec0ab5ecf85bc4fd2792c614509ee), and the CrowdFund contract [is deployed here](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xc746b51ef3e6e929ae6c67e843c555f45da7d051).
